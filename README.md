## Project Overview


The **Azure Bash and PowerShell Tutorial** is a comprehensive instructional module designed to introduce, explain, and demonstrate the usage of **Bash scripting** and **PowerShell** for automating and managing resources within the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform.

By first building foundational skills in Bash—a widely used Unix/Linux scripting language—and then progressing to PowerShell’s object-oriented capabilities, this tutorial prepares learners for versatile, cross-platform cloud automation.

## Learning Objectives

The primary objectives of this tutorial are:

### 1. Bash Scripting for Azure

- **Command-Line Foundation**  
  Learn core Bash commands, scripting constructs, loops, functions, and environmental variables.

- **Azure CLI with Bash**  
  Use Bash to automate Azure operations via the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI), including login, resource creation, and monitoring.

- **Environment Setup**  
  Install Azure CLI and configure shell environments on Linux/macOS/Windows (WSL).

- **File I/O and Logging**  
  Perform input/output operations, redirection, and maintain logs for executed commands.

- **Automation Scripts**  
  Build reusable `.sh` scripts for provisioning and managing Azure VMs, Resource Groups, and Networking components.

- **Error Handling and Debugging**  
  Use `trap`, `$?`, `set -e`, and `set -x` for robust error management.

### 2. PowerShell for Azure

- **PowerShell Scripting Basics**  
  Understand cmdlets, variables, pipeline operations, and control structures.

- **Azure PowerShell (`Az` Module)**  
  Automate Azure tasks using the `Az` module—create, update, and delete Azure resources programmatically.

- **Installation and Configuration**  
  Set up PowerShell Core, install Az modules, and configure authentication (interactive, service principal, managed identity).

- **Script Authoring and Execution**  
  Create `.ps1` scripts for infrastructure deployment, policy application, and tagging.

- **Logging and Exception Handling**  
  Implement `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and integrate logging with Azure Monitor.

- **Advanced Orchestration**  
  Leverage ARM templates, RBAC, and declarative policies within PowerShell workflows.
