## Project Overview

The **Azure PowerShell Tutorial** is a structured instructional module designed to introduce, explain, and demonstrate the usage of PowerShell for automating and managing resources within the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform.

By combining the declarative power of Azure Resource Manager with the scripting capabilities of PowerShell, this tutorial provides a hands-on pathway for learners, researchers, and practitioners to acquire cloud automation proficiency.
